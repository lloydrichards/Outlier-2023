        <b>What is Outlier?</b>
        <p>
          Hosted by the Data Visualization Society, Outlier is a hybrid
          conference that reflects and celebrates the global visualization
          community.
        </p>

        <b>How is Outlier different from other conferences?</b>
        <p>
          Outlier is an inclusive, diverse, and creative data visualization
          conference. We run a public call for speakers, which attracts not
          only well known thought leaders, but also people you may not have
          heard of who are shaping the field. We provide a virtual option and
          provide several ticketing options, so that everyone anywhere in the
          world can join. Attendees suggest and facilitate their own sessions
          through the unconferences. They also network and build long-lasting
          connections. 
        </p>
        <p>
          All this makes Outlier both a celebration of our community&rsquo;s
          talents and a glimpse into future data visualization developments.
        </p>

        <b>Is Outlier a hybrid event?</b>
        <p>
          Yes! We host Outlier online so that anyone, anywhere, can attend. For
          the first time, we will also have an in-person event in the lovely
          city of Porto, Portugal.
        </p>

        <b>When will the next Outlier take place?</b>
        <p>The next Outlier event will take place on 3-5 May, 2023.</p>

        <b>Where is the event talking place?</b>
        <p>In Porto: more information soon</p>

        <p>Virtually: more information soon</p>

        <b>

        <b>How is Outlier structured?</b>
        <p>
          Outlier is a hybrid event: virtual and in-person (Porto, Portugal)
          taking place on the 3rd, 4th and 5th of May. 
        </p>

        <p>
          We will have keynote speakers delivering talks and participating in
          panel discussions. We will also have a curated list of speakers
          providing talks and lightning talks. Attendees will also be able to
          host unconferences. 
        </p>

        <p>
          All these options will be available virtually and in-person. All
          talks will be recorded and all in-person talks will be livestreamed
          online. Due to time differences, some of the virtual talks might not
          be available to watch live at the in-person venue, but will be
          published at a later stage on our Youtube channel.
        </p>

        <p>
          This year we will also provide a set of workshops (virtually and
          in-person) as well as networking and cultural options.

        <b>What is the cost of a ticket?</b>

          We offer multiple pricing options because we don&rsquo;t want the
          price of a ticket to be a barrier for anyone who wants to attend:

        <b>Is it possible to request a free ticket like last year?</b>
        <p>
          We understand that cost can be a barrier that keeps you from
          attending. We are also aware that organsing a hybrid conference
          requires a lot of effort. If you&rsquo;re not able to afford any of
          the paid tickets above, you can volunteer for Outlier (virtual or
          in-person) and thus attend the conference. 
        </p>
        <b>Do different tickets come with different offers?</b>
        <p>
          All tickets grant the same all-access offerings. You only have to
          choose if you want to attend in-person, in Porto, or virtually.
        </p>
        <b>Where can I see the agenda?</b>
        <p>The agenda will be available a few weeks before the event.</p>
        <b>Will Outlier talks be recorded?</b>
        <p>
          Yes, talks will be recorded and be published at a later stage on our
          Youtube channel.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card-plum" id="faq-rules">
        <b>Does Outlier have a Code of Conduct?</b>
        <p>
          Yes, on top of the <a
            href="https://www.datavisualizationsociety.org/code-of-conduct"
            >DVS code of conduct</a
          >, we ask you to follow a few additional rules during the conference.
          Why is that? The events committee strives to be as transparent as
          possible, which includes ensuring the participants are aware of when
          something is a sponsored talk. Additionally, we want to maintain an
          inspiring and engaging space that isn&rsquo;t cluttered with
          recruiters and corporate messages.
        </p>
        <b>Can I pitch a product or company during Outlier?</b>
        <p>
          While we may have attendees who run their own businesses, are
          involved with startups, or are hiring managers who are actively
          recruiting, Outlier is designated to be a space for attendees to come
          together without needing to swat away pitches.
        </p>
        <p>
          We might have sponsored sessions and we will have sponsors booths, at
          the virtual platform and our venue in Porto, were sponsors can
          present their materials and/or products. Reach out to Outlier
          Director if you want to become a sponsor.
        </p>
        <b>How can I know what&apos;s considered as a pitch?</b>
        <p>
          Here are some examples of what is not considered as a pitch for
          non-sponsored events:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Casually mentioning that you have a book coming out as part of
              your introduction or as a side-note.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>

              with the tool with the purpose of educating and sharing skills.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Recruiters reaching out to participants who have volunteered
              their information as someone who is currently searching for a job
              and wants to connect to recruiters.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A hiring manager hosting a session on something totally unrelated
              to recruitment.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>And here are examples of what is considered as a pitch:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>

            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <b>Can I take pictures during the conference?</b>
        <p>
          The in-person event will have a photographer. We are aware that not
          all people like having their photo taken. Please make sure you let us
          know beforehand if that is your case. If you want to take a photo of
          a group of people, please ensure that you first ask for their
          consent. 
        </p>
        <b>Is there anything else I should keep in mind?</b>
        <p>
          We ask that you be respectful of others, and that you not interrupt
          those who are already speaking. Remember to pause and give space for
          others to engage. Respect others&rsquo; opinions even when you
          disagree with them, so that they can show you the same respect.

          We acknowledge that some folks who applied to speak and were not
          selected may feel disappointed, and we totally understand that. If
          time and budget allowed, we would have loved to have selected many
          more. It might also be the case that you want to talk about a topic
          but feel that 20 minutes is too long. Lightning talks are a great
          alternative way to get involved and share some of your most exciting
          insights and/or projects.
        </p>
        <b>What are the criteria for lightning talk videos?</b>
        <p>
          We ask you to keep the following in mind when recording and
          submitting the video:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>You must be a ticket holder to submit a lightning talk.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The video must be five minutes or less in its entirety.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The talk should not contain any offensive materials and must
              abide by the Data Visualization Society <a
                href="https://www.datavisualizationsociety.org/code-of-conduct"
                >Code of Conduct</a

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Do your best to create a quality video; here are
              some tips on how to best do this.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Lighting talks cannot be promotions or advertisements for any
              commercial purpose.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <b>Will there be a selection process?</b>
        <p>Yes, please read more here. </p>
        <b>What is an unconference session?</b>
        <p>
          An unconference (or unconf, for short) is a 1-hour long session that
          can be hosted by anyone in attendance. As long as you have a ticket
          to Outlier, you can host one or multiple unconference sessions,
          virtually or in-person.
        </p>
        <b>What type of sessions can I create?</b>
        <p>
          For the most part, whatever you like! You can host a session in any
          style or format you&rsquo;d like. See some examples below. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Talk</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Panel</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Discussion</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Q&amp;A / AMA (Ask Me Anything)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Hands-on learning session (e.g., workshop, hackathon, sketching
              contest)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Fun / Misc (e.g., games, music, etc.)</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <b>How can I create an unconference session?</b>
        <p>
          The Outlier app will be available a week before the conference.
          Download it on your mobile or visit the webapp to see what
          unconference sessions are already on the agenda. On the same agenda,
          choose if it&rsquo;s virtual or in-person, pick one of the available
          unconference slots, and add the details of your suggested session. An
          Outlier team member will then be notified, approve your session, and
          add it to the agenda along with the meeting room information
          (in-person) or link (virtual).
        </p>
        <b>Can I co-host my unconference session?</b>
        <p>
          We encourage people to collaborate and work together. Is someone else
          already planning to host a discussion you&rsquo;re also super keen to
          lead? Reach out to them! Perhaps they&rsquo;ll want to join forces!
        </p>
        <b>What&rsquo;s expected of me if I create a session?</b>
        <p>
          Unlike a traditional conference session, unconference sessions have
          less of a clear distinction between prepared speakers and audiences.
          Even if you present a talk, we hope you choose to leave room for
          discussion and questions. Everybody is encouraged to participate and
          contribute something interesting, whether through leading a session
          or sharing insights as participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          For in-person unconferences, Outlier can only provide the room and
          internet access. If you need other materials, you have to bring them
          yourself.
        </p>
        <b>What should I choose for a session topic?</b>
        <p>
          This is totally up to you (as long as it does not violate the Code of
          Conduct, of course), so we suggest whatever you&rsquo;re excited
          about! We imagine a lot of the sessions will be focused around data
          visualization topics. However, we also encourage people to plan
          sessions around topics that are only minorly tangential to data
          visualization, as well as topics that have nothing to do with data
          visualization. We believe that two people connecting over non-dataviz
          topics (e.g., animal welfare, hiking, etc.) or non-dataviz activities
          (e.g. yoga, games, etc.) is also a really great thing and we want to
          encourage that. 
        </p>
        <p>Some session topic ideas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Start an interesting debate or discussion about deep issues
              (e.g., a discussion around the data visualization around election
              polling)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Organize or suggest a panel on a popular topic</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Lead a workshop on your favorite tool</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Host an AMA; share your expertise!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Host a game, lead a yoga session, or some other fun activity</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Give an informal talk on something you&rsquo;re excited about
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Share your obscure hobby!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Tell us about a niche area of dataviz you&rsquo;ve fallen into
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Share a live-coding session</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Whatever else you can think of!</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <b>Do I need slides?</b>
        <p>
          No! Unconference sessions tend to be a bit more off-the-cuff. But, if
          you have slides you want to share, feel free to bring them along.
        </p>
        <b>Can I give a demo of our product?</b>
        <p>
          We do not allow product pitches. See more on this in the code of
          conduct section above.
        </p>
        <b>Will sessions be recorded?</b>
        <p>
          Unconferences will not be recorded. If you are in Porto, you can
          decide to join unconferences virtually or in-person. If you are
          joining online, you can choose between the virtual ones.
        </p>
        <b>Can I attend multiple unconference sessions?</b>
        <p>
          You are encouraged to move around freely and as often as you like.
          Don&rsquo;t feel the need to stay for an entire session. Move in and
          out as out of sessions as you please. Explore!

        <p>
          There is a checkbox in the bottom right corner of the screen that
          says “Autoplay”. Clicking the text or box will stop/start the
          animation. If you reload or navigate to another page, you will need
          to click the box again.
