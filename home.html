          Hosted by the
          <a href="https://www.datavisualizationsociety.org/"
            >Data Visualization Society</a
          >, Outlier is an annual conference to celebrate the global
          visualization community. We see this event as an opportunity to think
          outside the box and make something unique and different. For the
          first time, we will have a hybrid event: in-person in Porto,
          Portugal, and virtual.
        </p>

        <b>Connect with the community</b>
        <p>
          Outlier is all about connections: online or in-person you will find
          many opportunities for networking and connecting with the dataviz
          community in a variety of ways.
        </p>

        <b>Learn from our speakers and experts</b>
        <p>
          The field of data visualization includes people of many backgrounds,
          geographies, languages, and experience levels. We aim to secure a
          diverse lineup of speakers covering a wide range of topics to leave
          you feeling excited and inspired.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the first time, Outlier will also offer the possibility to attend
          in-person or virtual workshops (DVS MasterClasses at Outlier) to
          enhance your skills.
        </p>

        <b>Inspire others</b>
        <p>
          Want to host a Q&A, moderate a panel, run a discussion on a topic, or
          even host a game session? No problem! In addition to the curated
          talks, everyone will have an opportunity to plan unconference
          sessions, creating experiences by and for those in attendance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outlier does not follow a specific topic, but this year we are giving
          particular attention to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Inclusivity and Accessibility</li>
          <li>Business Intelligence and Analytics</li>
          <li>Infographics and Data Storytelling</li>
          <li>Data Art and Innovation</li>
          <li>Data Literacy, Data Culture and Data Teams</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Outlier 2023</b>

        <p>
          Organising an event as Outlier requires a lot of effort and
          resources. At DVS, inclusion is always one of our concerns, which is
          why we opted by organising a hybrid conference: virtual and
          in-person.
        </p>

        <p>
          Buying a ticket to the event and/or the workshops will allow DVS to
          cover the costs of organisation and supporting our sustainability.
        </p>

        <p>
          DVS is committed to providing opportunities for everyone to attend.
          We have a set of discounted tickets as well as the possibility to
          volunteer and, thus, attend the event for free. If price is an issue,
          if you want to buy a set of tickets or sponsor us, please contact
          Marília Cunha at

        <b>DVS MasterClasses at Outlier</b>

        <p>More information soon</p>

        <b>Porto</b>

        <p>
          Porto is a lovely city in the North of Portugal, the second largest
          in Portugal, but obviously the best if you ask locals (just kidding!
          … Better to find that out by yourself)
        </p>

        <b>How to get here?</b>

        <p>
          Flying is still the best way to reach Porto from abroad. You can also
          travel by <a href="https://www.cp.pt/passageiros/en">train</a> or by
          car (even though parking is tricky if your accommodation does not
          have a parking spot).
        </p>

        <b>Getting to and from the airport</b>

        <p>
          You can easily get to the airport or to the city centre by metro.
          Line E (Purple) runs every 20 or 30 minutes, depending on the time
          and day of the week. Know more about other options
          <a
            href="https://www.aeroportoporto.pt/en/opo/access-parking/getting-to-and-from-the-airport/public-transportation"
            >here.</a
          >
        </p>

        <b>Where to stay?</b>

        <p>
          There are plenty of hotels, hostels, and Airbnb options. Walking is
          always a good option, but the streets can be steep, so we recommend
          wearing comfortable shoes. Taxis and Ubers abound as well as buses
          and metro stations.
        </p>

        <b>What to do?</b>

        <p>
          Eat. Well, there are plenty of other things to do, but Portuguese
          people love to eat and drink. Some nice recommendations
          <a href="https://www.timeout.com/porto/city-guide">here.</a>
        </p>

        <b>Concerns</b>

        <p>
          The city is mostly safe, you just need to be careful with your
          belongings, especially in more touristic areas such as Ribeira.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some areas are under construction due to the metro expansion, so you
          might need to take some detours to get to where you want to go.
        </p>
        <p>
          Weather in May is usually good - sunny and warm, but with colder
          nights. It does rain a lot in Porto, but usually not in May.
        </p>

        <b>COVID-19 restrictions</b>

        <p>
          COVID-19 travel restrictions were lifted in Portugal. Providing proof
          of vaccination, recovery from COVID-19 or negative test results is
          not required. Know
          <a href="https://reopen.europa.eu/en/map/PRT/7001">more.</a>
        </p>

        <b>Event safety and inclusivity</b>

        <p>
          Like all DVS-hosted events, Outlier attendees are expected to abide
          by our
          <a href="https://www.datavisualizationsociety.org/code-of-conduct"
            >Code of Conduct</a
          >
          to ensure a welcoming and inclusive event for all attendees. This
          extends to attendees joining in person, and virtually.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are mindful of the continued concerns around COVID-19 and are
          committed to creating a safe event for attendees who opt to join in
          person. Here is what you can expect if attending in person:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Attendees are encouraged to be up to date on their COVID-19
            vaccinations, including the most recent bivalent booster.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have a positive COVID test that unfortunately prevents you
            from attending, we will give you the option to have your ticket
            price refunded.
          </li>
          <li>
            Masks are not required. We ask that attendees be kind and
            respectful of others, particularly those who are opting for
            different levels of protection from yourself.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We encourage data visualization enthusiasts to join the event the way
          they feel most comfortable.
